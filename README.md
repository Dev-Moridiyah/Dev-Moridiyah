### Hey, I'm Moridiyah 👋🏽
I'm a front-end designer who loves building things that actually work. Most of my projects here are for practice or school, so they might be simple but they're mine, and I'm proud of how far I've come.

### ⚡ Fun fact: 
- I love learning in simple ways. If it’s not in plain English, it’s not for me.
- My hobbies are baking, coding and vlogging.
