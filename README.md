### Hey, I'm Moridiyah 👋🏽
I'm a front-end designer who loves building things that actually work. Most of my projects here are for practice or school, so they might be simple but they're mine, and I'm proud of how far I've come.

### 🎀 Fun fact: 
- I learn best when things are explained simply. If they’re not, I’ll probably zone out.
- My hobbies are baking, coding and vlogging.

### 💻 Currently Learning:
